<h1> JavaTasks </h1>
<h3>Repo for Java tasks, review, algorithms and etc.</h3> 

<p></p>
  Here you can find my Java prctice tasks, wich I've completed to improve my skills 
  in Java programming and everything what can be useful for Java developer.
<p></p>
  My plan is to update this document every time I complete the task, so you can easily 
  navigate through all my repositories and quickly find what you want to.
