<h1> JavaTasks </h1>
<h3>Repo for Java tasks, review, algorithms and etc.</h3> 

<p></p>
  Here you can find my Java prctice tasks, wich I've completed to improve my skills 
  in Java programming and everything what can be useful for Java developer.
<p></p>
  My plan is to update this document every time I complete the task, so you can easily 
  navigate through all my repositories and quickly find what you want to. Also I will add
  new lines to this list from up, so <b><em>first</em></b> message will always be at the <b><em>bottom</em></b> of page and
  <b><em>last</em></b> message will always be at the <b><em>top</em></b>.
<p></p>
  I have one <a href = "/src/main/Main.java">Main</a> class to run my tasks. 
<p></p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I've started to learn a sorting topic and created a <a href = "/src/pack01/Sorter.java">Sorter</a> 
      class for this purpose. Basic int[] insertionSort.
    </li>
    <li>
      So far I've completed just basic task with <a href = "/src/pack01/Message.java">Message</a> enum
      just to create basic structure of application and repository.
    </li>
  </ul>
