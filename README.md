  Here you can find my Java prctice tasks, wich I've completed to improve my skills 
  in Java programming and everything what can be useful for Java developer.
<p></p>
  My plan is to update this document every time I complete the task, so you can easily 
  navigate through all my repositories and quickly find what you want to. Also I will add
  new lines to this list from up, so <b><em>first</em></b> message will always be at the <b><em>bottom</em></b> of page and
  <b><em>last</em></b> message will always be at the <b><em>top</em></b>.
<p></p>
  I have one <a href = "/src/main/Main.java">Main</a> class to run my tasks.
